## TODO (not implemented)

- mitigate sharing shard buffs outside the clan that holds the shard. strip shard buffs on clan changes. think about potential workarounds
  - e.g. shard holder joins a clan, they all grab the buff, then the shard holder leaves. simply removing the buff from the holder when they leave wouldn't be enough.
  - e.g. exposing castle heart to take control of shard
  - optional, can be enabled/disabled. default enabled
- strip shard buff from players when the placed shard is picked up / dropped on the ground
  - optional, can be enabled/disabled. default enabled
